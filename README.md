# CSC226 Final Project

Ô∏èExclamation Marks  Ô∏èindicate action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which 
  they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no ‚ùóÔ∏èin it!)

**References**: TA, Scott Heggen, 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: The title of our project is Braniac Blitz.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this final projectself is to create a fun and energetic game suggesting a quick 
              test of knowledge.

**Sources**: Our original project would be based on the Game of Nim

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Please write a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and replace it with your own:

Ô∏è**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

1. Branch 1 name: glek
2. Branch 2 name: douthitj

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

We will be looking at your commit history for changes: 

   1. No changes (i.e., commits), and no credit for Milestone 2
   2. Meaningless commits don't count; make good commit messages!
   3. Meaningless code doesn't count; make real progress by Milestone 2! 
   4. I do not expect perfection! Show me you're making smart choices. Remember the suggested 
      [incremental development from Chapter 15.11](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/2024_Spring_CSC226/gu-iand-event-driven-programming_a-programming-example.html)

Use this space to reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you 
worried about? What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not us.
 

```
    We created 2 classes, Class Question and Class Quiz. Class Question handles a single question, and contains
    two function definitions. Class Quiz contains six function defitions. Our current code projects the GUI, which 
    is partially complete. We also ask the user for their username. So far we think it's going quite well, everything 
    is on track. We are not behind, and right now our main concern is figuring out how to store the user's score, and how to make the game more engaging.    
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

Ô∏è**Completion Percentage**: `55%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    **Replace this text with your reflection
```

‚ùóÔ∏èKeep your issue queue up to date, and continue to refine your code! We will be looking at your commit history again.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button in PyCharm. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. 
These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. 
Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and deficiencies that remain in your code. 
Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóReflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
